# Christmas Lyrics 🎄
##### A short python script that visualizes christmas songs locally in your terminal. No imports necessary.

## Setup

Assuming you already have python downloaded, start by cloning this repository:

You should see the dazzling christmas tree changing colors in your console! The lyrics to Jingle Bells will appear below the tree.

Ctrl + C
```

## Next Steps
